Unzip the file via [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), and add the extracted folder to your PATH (see [here for env help](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)).

## Tellopy side projects

### Hand_motion Tello controller

You can find a hand_motion controller for the Tello in this project: https://github.com/GalBrandwine/HalloPy,
and controll your tello using hand movements!

###  OpenCV based Tello controller

This interfaces with the drone through openCV and generates frames from the video stream for computer vision applications. It comes with a tracker that will detect a color in the scene and follow it:
